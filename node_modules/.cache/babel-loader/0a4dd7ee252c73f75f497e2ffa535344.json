Traditionally, associations between cytokine data (1) and clinical phenotypes (5) are tested directly using univariate models. CytoMod independently uses absolute cytokine profiles (1) or adjusted cytokine profiles (2) to generate cytokine modules (3)-sets of co-signaling cytokines within a given cohort. Modules are generated using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Associations are then tested between module levels (4) and clinical phenotypes (5). By significantly reducing the number of associations tested CytoMod increases the statistical power to detect associations. By comparing modules across datasets, CytoMod can also identify \\u201Ccores\\u201D of cytokines that consistently co-signal together. \", React.createElement(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01338/\",\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 25\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"(Cohen et al., 2019)\"))), React.createElement(\"td\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 27\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, React.createElement(\"img\", {\n    src: methodFlow,\n    alt: \"The flow as presented in the article\",\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 27\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }), \";\"))), React.createElement(\"h2\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 31\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, React.createElement(\"span\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 31\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Further Explanation\")), React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    style: {\n      fontSize: 20\n    },\n    className: \"pt-running-text\",\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 32\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Since analyzing large amount of cytokines requires multiple hypothesizes, which under takes the statistical power of the analysis, Cohen et al developed a computational approach, names CytoMod, for analyzing and identifying cytokines modules with statistical efficiency (Cohen et al., 2019).
